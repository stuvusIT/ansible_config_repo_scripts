# ansible_config_repo_scripts
A collection of useful scripts for ansible config repos

This is intended to be included as a submodule in an ansible config repo.

## Requirements

- Ansible
- git
- Python 3 with the modules PyYAML, netaddr, and JMESPath

### Ubuntu/Debian or other APT based systems

```bash
sudo apt install ansible git python3 python3-netaddr python3-jmespath python3-yaml
```

### Nix/NixOS

If you have [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/), then `nix-shell` automatically makes the requirements available.
The playbook script will automatically call `nix-shell` if it's present or you can launch it in a shell yourself.
You may want to link/copy the shell.nix to the root of your config repo.

## Usage

Ansible config repos are typically heavily based on git submodules.
To update them (and also initialize them if they are not initialized yet), the script `submodules` may help.

The `playbook.sh` script is designed to run playbooks from anywhere.

```
$ # Syntax
$ playbook.sh <ansible_args> <playbook_name_without_yml>
$
$ # Example
$ playbook.sh -l hypervisor01 all
```

The special playbook `all` is generated by `scripts/mkplaybook.py` and doesn't exist physically.

### mkplaybook

`mkplaybook` generates a playbook based on group memberships and `roles.yml`.
For every role in the `roles/` directory, a host group with the same name is assumed and a proper play is generated.
The facts are only gathered once.
For every role a tag is generated named `_ROLENAME`.

The `roles.yml` contains a dict with the role name as key and settings as values.

| `Name`     | `Description`                                  |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `early`    | Run this role before all other non-early roles |
| `late`     | Run this role after all other non-late roles   |
| `hosts`    | Also run this role on these hosts/groups       |
| `excludes` | Short form for `hosts: [ !HOST ]`              |
| `after`    | Always run this role after the specified roles |
| `tags`     | Apply these additional tags                    |

## Expected directory structure of parent repo

The script in this repository expect the following directories in the parent repo:

### hosts

`hosts` should contain all *host files* with their variables.
Each host has an own file `hosts/<hostname>.yml`.
Additionally you can add files in `hosts/<hostname>/`.
For example,

```bash
hosts/myhost/first.yml
hosts/myhost/second.yml
```

will result in a host `myhost` with the variables from `first` and `second` merged.

There is the special variable `_groups` which is the list of names of groups which the host is a member of.
Every other variable is just passed to Ansible as variables applying to that host.

### groups

`groups/` should contain *group files* which specify *group variables*
Each group has an own file, called `groups/<groupname>.yml`.
Just as with hosts, you can additionally add files in `groups/<groupname>/`

There are three special groups:

- `all` contains all hosts (even though they don't list `all` in their `_groups`).
  Therefore `groups/all.yml` contains the default variables which apply to all hosts.
- `ungrouped` contains all hosts without any groups.
  This should however never be the case.
- `virtual` contains all hosts with a `vm` variable defined.

### playbooks

All Playbook files should be located in `groups/playbooks/`.
Each one should begin with a comment describing what it's supposed to do.

### roles

All roles (typically as submodules) used in the repo.

### files

Files which are used in the repo (e.g. config files used by roles).

### modules

Custom modules used in the repo.

### user.yml
The file `user.yml` is used to configure user specific settings like the `ansible_user`.
This file should be in the `.gitignore`

### roles.yml
A file containing some rules about the order of roles in the repo

#### Example:
```yaml
---
# All roles with non-default values.
# Please sort the keys alphabetically within the three sections.

#####
# Early roles
#####

apt_sources:
  early: true
  hosts:
    - all
  after:
    - fstab
  tags:
    - common

fstab:
  early: true
  hosts:
    - all
  tags:
    - common

sudo:
  early: true
  hosts:
    - all
  tags:
    - common

#####
# Late roles
#####

upgrade:
  late: true
  hosts:
    - all

#####
# Normal roles
#####

grub2:
  after:
    - crypttab
    - fstab

icinga2-client:
  hosts:
    - all
  after:
    - icinga2-master
    - icinga2-scripts
  tags:
    - common
```

### ansbile.cfg
The ansible config.
It is important that the variable `inventory` is set to `<path-to-this-submodule>/inventory.py`

### environment
A file with some environment variables. See below.

## Special variables

Some important special variables are:

- `_groups` is a mandatory variable per host and is a list of groups that host is a member of
- `ansible_host` is a mandatory variable per host and is the IP address which ansible uses to
  connect to that host
- `ansible_user` is the username used to connect to the server.

The [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_inventory.html#list-of-behavioral-inventory-parameters)
lists more variables which are recognized by Ansible.

## Environment

To ensure consistent playbook executions, the entire environment is dropped before the Playbook is
ran.
However, as some environment variables are needed for correct playbook exection, they can be set
from files in the repository.
There are two files both located in the repository root:
`./environment` and `./environment.local`.
While `environment` must exist and has to be committed, `environment.local` is optional and must not be committed.
Both work in the same way having simple assignments in bash style.
Lines may be empty or start with `#` to indicate a comment.
Comments after assignments are treated as parts of the assignments.
Assignments may contain blank characters.

Example:
```bash
# This is a comment followed by an empty line

SOME_VAR=some value
LANG=
```

Assignments with an empty value are filled from the parent environment (your shell).
If the variable doesn't exist in the parent environment, it is ignored.
